The goal of this project is to write a DLNA server in ruby that transcodes
flash video using ffmpeg so I can point it at an ATOM feed of YouTube and Vimeo
videos and watch them on my Xbox.

Currently this project is in development and is not close to working yet. I
am taking the approach of sniffing traffic from an Xbox and implementing
the bare minimum that will get video playing on the Xbox. After that the
different versions of the protocols can be added so that other devices will
work.
